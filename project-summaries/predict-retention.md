This capstone, completed in conjunction with my University's Office of Institutional Research & Effectiveness, analyzed National Survey of Student Engagement data for the 2017 first-year cohort to uncover drivers of retention and on-time graduation. After rigorous cleaning that cut the sample to include only high-quality records and reduced dimensionality through correlation screens, I modeled year-two through year-four retention with logistic regression and explored over five hundred variable combinations. Two predictors emerged as consistently powerful: first-year GPA and a student’s answer to “Would you attend this institution if you could start over?” A one-point rise in GPA roughly tripled the odds of a student retaining, while moving from a “definitely no” to “definitely yes” response raised odds twenty to thirty-fold. Advising patterns also mattered. Students who relied on friends or family for academic advice were 80-plus percent less likely to return than those who consulted their assigned advisor, evidence that helped prompt the university to hire a team of professional advisors for first-year and undeclared students. High-impact practices and NSSE engagement indicators showed weak associations, suggesting that broader survey redesign is needed for sharper insight. Key recommendations included early alerts for low-GPA students, targeted outreach to those expressing uncertainty about their choice of school, and a retention-specific survey that probes advising relationships, disability support, and resilience factors. Since the dataset used and code written fall under a confidentiality agreement, I cannot post it. This project summary is still a work in progress.
