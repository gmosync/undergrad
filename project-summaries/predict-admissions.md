This project used supervised classification models to predict whether an admitted student will choose to enroll at my university, based on historical admissions data from 2017 to 2021. I worked with a dataset of over 15,000 records and 69 features, engineered several new variables, cleaned redundant or noisy inputs, and resolved issues like aliased coefficients and multicollinearity. After testing multiple models like logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, bagging, random forests, and boosting, I found logistic regression performed best with a Kappa test score of 0.552. The most predictive variables included top-percent-in-class, early decision plan, campus visits, and engagement with recruiting materials. These results confirmed that yield is largely driven by both academic competitiveness and demonstrated interest, especially early decision commitment and high on-campus engagement. The models also suggested that traditional demographic or test score data alone were weaker signals of intent to enroll. I used VIF and Gini-based importance scores to interpret variable impact and rewrote the dataset multiple times to accommodate numeric-only algorithms. Since the dataset used and code written fall under a confidentiality agreement, I cannot post it. This project summary is still a work in progress.
