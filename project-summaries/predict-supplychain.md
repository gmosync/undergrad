This project was for a major tech OEM. I built a multivariable linear regression model to predict in-transit lead times for a global supply chain, using six months of order-level data. The goal was to quantify how shipping choices, specifically origin site, transport mode, and timing, affect delivery delays during a period of volatile logistics. After cleaning timestamp errors, I engineered a log-transformed lead time variable, and dropped perfectly collinear predictors. I then fit an OLS model that explained 85.6% of the variance in delivery times. The model confirmed that ship mode was the dominant driver (with ocean significantly slower than air or ground), but also captured meaningful site effects and seasonal trends. I used the results to simulate trade-offs under budget constraints, and showed how mixing faster lanes with cheaper modes could save several days on urgent orders without exceeding freight cost limits. The final report included findings and recommendations to the OEM directly. Since the dataset used and code written fall under a confidentiality agreement, I cannot post it. This project summary is still a work in progress.
